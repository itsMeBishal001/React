# Difference between a Library and Framework?
## Library 
a library is not an independently executable unit, but an additional module that is requested by a programme.

libraries are collections of classes and functions, which is why they are sometimes also called component or class libraries. With the help of a programme interface (API / Application Programming Interface), access to the necessary functions from the library is made possible. However, access is only limited to the “public” functions; libraries also have “private” functions that work in the background but remain hidden from the outside world.
## Framework
You can think of a software development framework like the basic structure of a house including the support pillars and beams as well as central electrics and plumbing infrastructure.

The framework provides the flow of a software application and tells the developer what it needs and calls the code provided by the developer as required. 

# What is CDN? Why do we use it?

content delivery network

A large portion of all internet content is delivered through CDNs. Here is a simple example:

If you were in New York and wanted to view the website of your favorite store in London that’s hosted on a server in the UK, you would experience slow content load times if the request had to travel all the way across the Atlantic Ocean. To remedy this, a CDN would store a cached version of the London website content in multiple geographical locations around the world, also called “points of presence” (PoPs). These PoPs contain their own caching servers and are responsible for delivering that content close to where you’re located in New York.

Content delivered from a server closest to your physical location gives you a faster, high-performance web experience.

# Why is React known as React?

React is called React because it was designed to be a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

The name "React" was chosen because the library was designed to allow developers to "react" to changes in state and data within an application, and to update the user interface in a declarative and efficient manner.

React was developed by Facebook and released in 2013, and it has since become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building web and mobile applications. It is used by many companies and organizations around the world, and it has a large and active developer community.
