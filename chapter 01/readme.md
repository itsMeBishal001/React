# Difference between a Library and Framework?
## Library 
libraries are collections of classes and functions, which is why they are sometimes also called component or class libraries. With the help of a programme interface (API / Application Programming Interface), access to the necessary functions from the library is made possible. However, access is only limited to the “public” functions; libraries also have “private” functions that work in the background but remain hidden from the outside world.
## Framework
